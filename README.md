# RESTful-Blog-API

## This was a challenge/assignment from [EDX](https://edx.org), course ["Introduction to Node.js"](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-nodejs), Module 2.

To easily test it, you need to open two *bash/cmd* windows on the working folder, and then:
  * On the first one, use the command **npm start**;
  * On the second one, use the command **sh test.sh**;
  * Try to have both *bash/cmd* windows on the screen, so you can see the server logs and client responses simultaneously.
